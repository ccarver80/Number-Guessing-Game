# Number-Guessing-Game
Quick python script for a number guessing game, from chapter 3 of "Invent your own games with python"

I made a few updates to the original text from the book, first thing was to play with the "import time" statement. I added to give the player a few seconds to read the opening line. 

I could later add this to each time the player guesses, maybe simulating the computer is thinking?

I also added a check system to make sure the number the player types is between the range.

If a person wants to make the game harder they can increase the range on line 14
